Index Terms—Medical imaging , signal processing . 1 . INTRODUCTION Medical image acquisition revolutionized many routine medical diagnostic treatment procedures . number imaging modalities , starting 100 years old X- rays , including magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , com- puted tomography ( CT ) , single-photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , ultrasound , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) , others be- come common hospitals physician ofces around world . Development existence modali- ties heavily dependent advances achieved general eld signal processing lead ability image vivo biological structures 2-D , 3-D , 4-D recently 5-D. 2 . IMAGE ACQUISITION Medical imaging provides image information variety scanners . X-ray projection images ( e.g. , chest X-ray ) serve example common 2-D imaging modality . 2-D imaging workhorse medical imag- ing technology 20thcentury , 3-D modalities like X-ray CT , MRI , SPECT , PET become commonly used last decade past century . scanners ( especially CT MR ) frequently used 4-D mode depicting motion together 3-D structure and/or morphology – MR imaging beating heart CTimaging breathing lungs may serve examples . context , 5-D imaging represents , e.g. , longitudinal imaging beating heart cancerous tumor inside breath- ing lung period several days/weeks/months depict temporal changes morphology and/or function . Traditionally , medical imaging relied 2-dimensional approaches image formation . Starting therst X-ray image 1895 , X-rays become invaluable means imaging internals human body . X-ray tech- nology became tomographic later 3-dimensional Radon transform facilitated image reconstruction pro- jections caused rotating X-ray beam . number multi- beam scenarios currently exists including fan-beam imaging subsequent reconstruction . combining multiple X-ray sources multiple X-ray detectors , rotational speed 0.28 sec axial scanning speed 40 cm/sec , entire chest region imaged 0.5 sec entire human body head toe 5 seconds . Magnetic resonance imaging represents another inher- ently 3-D/4-D imaging modality . MRI , high-strength magneticeld used align magnetization hydrogen atoms water forms human body . Magne- tization alignment may altered radio frequencyelds , forming rotating magneticeld hydrogen nuclei . eld detected MR scanner . complex signal manipulation , 2-D , 3-D , 4-D images formed . number imaging modalities exist – ultrasound allows 2-D , 3-D recently 4-D ( also called real- time 3-D ) imaging . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) emerging very-high resolution imaging modality – due high frequency utilized laser light , depth penetration relatively low . Despite fact , OCT found tremendous use non-invasive 3-D imaging human retina coronary plaque cap imaging . mentioned modalities relies heavily advanced complex signal processing pipelines perfect acquired image signal thus provide highest qual- ity highest resolution images available . Achieving good image quality subjecting patients minimal doses ionizing radiation , inherent imaging techniques , important challenge signal processing community . 5756 978-1-4577-0539-7/11/ $ 26.00 ©2011 IEEE ICASSP 2011 Authorized licensed use limited : UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA .

IMAGE ANALYSIS Despite fact image acquisition subsequent visual assessment acquired images still represent current standard care even developed countries , quan- titative image analysis slowly paving way gen- eral acceptance . Motivated fact humans good visual estimation dimensions , especially 3- higher dimensional spaces , estimates highly irreproducible , manual tracing structures inter- est tedious time consuming ( still reproducible ) , highly automated image analysis approaches in- creasingly sought accepted research applications . clinical applications closely follow number clinically utilized quantitative analysis methods . Quantitative analysis coronary arterial stenoses among therst routinely clinically accepted approaches medical image analysis ( Fig . 1 ) [ 1,2 ] . Numerous quantitative image analysis approaches exist cardiologic applications , including quantitative analysis coronary plaque in- travascular ultrasound [ 3 ] , 3-D 4-D analysis morphol- ogy function cardiac ventricles ultrasound , CT , MR images ( Fig . 2 ) [ 4 , 5 ] , and/or 4-D analysis aor- tic morphology function MR images . Quantitative image analysis ultrasound-imaged carotid arteries shown provide early detection systemic cardiovascular disease , serve independent predictor heart attack stroke ( Fig . 3 ) . Many application areas exists , including compre- hensive systems pulmonary image analysis multi- detector CT images ( Fig . 3 ) , methods approaches brain image analysis ( substantial effort devoted human brain anatomical analysis functional mapping ) , orthope- dic image analysis ( e.g. , quantitative analysis articular cartilage knee joint – Fig . 4 ) [ 6 ] , whole spectrum 5757 Authorized licensed use limited : UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA .
