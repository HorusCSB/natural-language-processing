( 2 ) Due certain defects system related equipment , image quality decreases sharply , called image degradation . reflection image degradation blurred content . image restoration processing , surface layer needs processed make clear . ( 3 ) Image compression coding mainly process permutation combination digital images accordance certain procedures . process image processing , image data large often needs huge memory support , consumes lot time image transmission . Thus , processing image , special processing needed reduce amount memory , called image compression coding [ 2 ] . process image compression , clarity needs ensured also clarity changed compression . compression image form coding original way process . ( 4 ) Image segmentation one digital image processing technologies . technology different others , special meanings , also help us analyze edges image . Though many methods image edge processing developed present , difficult applied different kinds images . Thus , necessary conduct deeper research image segmentation technology [ 3 ] . Onlyby constantly improving image segmentation technology better ensure image clarity , also requires relevant staff conduct constant in-depth analysis research . B . Application Image Processing Technology Image processing technology involved various fields China . Among , use technology medical field help doctors observe actual situation patients clearly , analyze judge disease quickly . example , medical field , B-ultrasound , X-ray intuitively observe physical condition patients , doctors perform diagnosis analysis quickly [ 3 ] . Thus , technology widely used medical field . use technology industrial field help employees inspect products ensure production quality . production enterprises gradually developed toward automation , image processing technology help employees improve work efficiency , ensure quality industrial products improve benefits enterprises . Text main tool data transmission communication , basic processing method image processing technology . text recognition function mainly scan recognize written text , recognize text image accordingly [ 4 ] . scanned text presented computer stored form graphics . present , continuous development science technology , scanning text image automatically converted text document computer . continuous research technology , mature also recognize images mixed pictures text . II HEDESIGN DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING SYSTEM . Original Intention Digital Image Design change times , digital image technology gradually involved various fields , scope using technology gradually expanding . using technology , many people pay attention specific internal structure system , image processing completed . Instead , care whether displayed picture get desired result . essence displaying images allow customers observe images intuitively . provide users better senses , requires staff optimize system . people start learn data image processing , use digital processing system better help learn relevant theoretical knowledge observe learn intuitively . ) Image Input . Image input includes digital image , image scanning video image input.Firstly , digital image input transfer image directly computer 1642021 International Conference Computers , Information Processing Advanced Education ( CIPAE ) 978-1-6654-2665-7/21/ $ 31.00 ©2021 IEEE DOI 10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00047 2021 International Conference Computers , Information Processing Advanced Education ( CIPAE ) | 978-1-6654-2665-7/21/ $ 31.00 ©2021 IEEE | DOI : 10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00047 Authorized licensed use limited : UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA .

form digital image file , computer performs corresponding processing . Secondly , image scanning input method includes two kinds . One use electronic scanner convert pictures digital images transfer computer . use digital camera shoot . Thirdly , video image input mainly transmit TV image signal video recorder computer , divided two kinds . One use digital cameras , etc. , transmit digital form photography equipment . ordinary photography equipment , uses video capture card specially configured ordinary equipment transmit signal computer , process video image [ 5 ] . B . Image Processing Analysis Image processing also called image processing technology . technology divided image restoration , segmentation processing methods usually performs processing treatment digital images . ) Design Framework Image Processing System . design digital image processing system , Windows technology mainly used make optimized human-computer interface . continuous progress science technology , requirements system functions gradually increasing . Thus , research digital image control system deepening gradually [ 6 ] . b ) Design File Module.In digital image processing system , basic one file operation , mainly scans , opens , prints modifies text image . designing file module , processed many ways ensure compatibility system certain degree . c ) Design Image Editing Module.Image editing mainly includes following aspects . One copy paste images insert text ; image editing , users copy paste images operations ; third paste save copied file files , save image . Users also write corresponding text text interpret image . ) Design Image Processing Module.The image processing module design mainly deal grayscale image . Grayscale particularity , using grayscale image , users need calculate change points geometry image instead considering problem palette . e ) Image Point Calculation.Image point operation relatively simple effective form operations [ 7 ] . Itcan help users change grayscale data , also make image specific order intuitive display . Image grayscale simple effective image processing tool among image processing technologies . display image form curve graph , changes correspondingly according change function . f ) Image Geometric Operation.The geometric transformation image mainly transform size , also basic operation image processing simplify processing method . two ways transform image position . One mirror image rotate image directly . , mirror image divided horizontal vertical types . horizontal mirror image mainly transforms left right sides image center position axis , vertical one transforms image horizontal central axis center . g ) Image Orthogonal Transformation.The image orthogonal transformation image mainly strengthen restore image . image signal transformed spatial domain frequency domain , image processed analyzed frequency domain , improve speed point operation [ 8 ] . image orthogonal transformation helps extract image eigenvalue achieve deeper compression . h ) Image Enhancement.It eliminates interfering factors image content image processed optimizes visual effect , enhances picture identification computer equipment [ 9 ] . ) Image Restoration.The degraded part image restored transformed original one . instance , image defocused , inverse filtering technology used eliminate defocus image . C. Image Output Image data transmission module mainly used image frame information description . Alternatively , module describes information provided image , transmits data stored queue data block according preset form [ 10 ] . image output display provide people computers data images easy recognize understand . image output includes soft copy hard copy . 165 Authorized licensed use limited : UNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE MARINGA .
